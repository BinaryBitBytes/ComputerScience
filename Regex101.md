# Regex 101- Regular Expressions

## Introductory
---
A Regex is known as a Regular expressions, or regex for short, are a series of special characters that define a search pattern. We will navigate a search pattern bases on literal characters that will produce a regex search pattern with a result by deliminating meta characters withing each of the data sets to redact the required results to each of the respected regex components. In this document I will go about describing each of the respected regular expressions in detail and provide a functional example for each regular expression to better help the reader understand how the regular expressions are written and what they are doing.

## Summary
-------------

This document will introduce methods & solutions to provide the reader with the respected solutions that will quantify their understanding of regular expressions. Below in the table of contents I will address each of the topics in detail, provide supporting resources, and best explain and demonstrate these regular expressions with a functioning example. I will include a code snippet of each of the respected regex functions for the reader. In these running examples I will outline the meta characters and explain them such as; \d for number and . for any character as well as * for 0 or more and also combine .* for any character 0 or more of which is known as a 'wild card'.

## Regex Components
---------------

### Anchors

#### *__SOURCES__* :
---------------

>> - __https://www.regular-expressions.info/anchors.html__ : The caret ^ matches the position before the first character in the string and $ matches right after the last character in the string. __Anchors do not match characters__, *rather they match positions* of characters __*before, inbetween, or after*__ in a regular expression in a __specific position__ of a string or value. These searches on anchors can only find __zero-length matches__ but they can also be used to create searches for __complications__.
